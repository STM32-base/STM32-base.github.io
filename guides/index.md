Guides will guide you through the process of getting something done. What that is, is explained at the beginning of the guide. After completely following a guide, you will be left with, for example, a working STM32-base setup.

Some guides are specific to the STM32-base project. Other guides may be useful when you are not even using the STM32-base project.
